# Project: Basic Implementation of a Calculation API and a Person Mock API in C# with dotNet6

---

Welcome to my project of basic implementation of a Calculation API and a Person Mock API in C# using the dotNet6 framework!

### About the Project

In this project, I explored the fundamentals of developing RESTful APIs in C# and dotNet6, focusing on creating a simple API for calculation operations and a mock API for the Person class. During this process, I learned about:

- **Environment Setup**: I configured a dotNet6 development environment on my local machine.
- **Project Structure**: I organized the project following the recommended conventions of ASP.NET Core.
- **Endpoint Routing**: I defined routes and endpoints to handle different calculation operations and access to mock Person data.
- **Data Modeling**: I created simple models to represent the input and output data of calculation operations and the Person class.
- **Business Logic**: I implemented the calculation logic for basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Person Mock API**: I developed a mock API to provide sample data for the Person class.

### Technologies Used

- **C#**: The primary programming language of the project.
- **dotNet6**: I used the latest version of the .NET framework to leverage its newest features.
- **ASP.NET Core**: The framework used to develop web applications and RESTful APIs in C#.
